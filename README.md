crud-express-node-mongo-starter
===============================
crud-express-node-mongo was inspired by and is based on [How to Create a Complete Express.js + Node.js + MongoDB CRUD and REST Skeleton](https://www.airpair.com/javascript/complete-expressjs-nodejs-mongodb-crud-skeleton)

## Installation
- Perform a clone of this repo. 
- Make sure MongoDB is installed (`brew install mongodb`)
- Install packages and start the express.js web service (`npm install && npm start`)
- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to see the express.js welcome page

## Usage Instructions
All of the MVC pieces are built, but are also rudimentary and not flashy. The root of our webapp goes to the express.js landing page, but there is a schema created for a new object called `blobs`. To access `blobs`, follow the route that is already in place by going to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/blobs`.

All of the REST pieces are baked in as well. You can test them using a multitude of different REST based tools.
